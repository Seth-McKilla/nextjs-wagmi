# Welcome to the NextJS wagmi starter template ðŸ‘‹

Looking to get up and running with a Typescript / NextJS dApp as quickly as possible? You're in the right place! This repo serves as a minimal template for integrating the wagmi React hooks for Ethereum library with Typescript & NextJS. Due to its ease of customizability and extensibility, this template has been styled with the Tailwind CSS framework. Let's get to it!

### Check out the live demo ðŸ‘‰ [NextJS wagmi](https://nextjs-wagmi.vercel.app/)

## Get up and running in 3 simple steps:

### 1. Create an app using this repo as the template

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/Seth-McKilla/nextjs-wagmi
```

> Note: The above command automatically downloads and installs the dependencies so no "npm install" or "yarn add" required!

### 2. Rename the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and add your Infura API Key

```yaml
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=<insert infura api key>
```

> Note: Grab an Infura API Key from the [Infura website](https://infura.io/)

### 3. Start the local development environment

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

That's it, you're all set!
